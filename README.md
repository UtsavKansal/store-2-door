A final project for CPSC 304 - Introduction to Relational Databases, Summer 2020 T1. This project is a bare bones skeleton for a delivery/service app. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this app was designed to help people who are immunocompromised, disabled, or for other reasons - aren't able to go out to purchase essential items.
